3.read about the difference between window,screen and document in java script

1.window Object:

The window object is the top-level object in the browser's object model. It represents the browser window or tab.
All global JavaScript variables and functions are defined on the window object. For example, if you declare a global variable like var x = 10;, it becomes a property of the window object (window.x).
It provides methods for interacting with the browser window, such as opening or closing windows, setting timeouts, and navigating to URLs.
Example:
// Accessing a global variable
console.log(window.x); // 10

// Opening a new window
window.open("https://www.example.com", "_blank");

2.screen Object:

The screen object represents the user's screen or display.
It provides information about the screen's width, height, color depth, and other properties.
Developers can use this information to create responsive designs or adjust the layout based on the user's screen characteristics.
Example:
// Getting screen width and height
console.log(screen.width);  // Width of the screen
console.log(screen.height); // Height of the screen

3.document Object:

The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser.
It provides methods and properties for interacting with the content of the document, such as manipulating HTML elements, handling events, and modifying the document structure.
DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation is done through the document object.
Example:
// Changing the content of an HTML element
document.getElementById("myElement").innerHTML = "New Content";

// Adding an event listener
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button Clicked!");
});


4.codekata practice

CodeKata is a term coined by Dave Thomas, one of the authors of "The Pragmatic Programmer." CodeKata is a set of programming exercises that are designed to help programmers improve their skills through deliberate practice. These exercises cover a variety of topics and can be solved using different programming languages.

Here's a simple example of a CodeKata exercise. Let's create a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

// CodeKata: Fibonacci Sequence
// Calculate the nth Fibonacci number

function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
}

// Testing the function
console.log(fibonacci(0)); // Output: 0
console.log(fibonacci(1)); // Output: 1
console.log(fibonacci(2)); // Output: 1
console.log(fibonacci(3)); // Output: 2
console.log(fibonacci(4)); // Output: 3
console.log(fibonacci(5)); // Output: 5
// ...

// Note: The naive recursive approach is not the most efficient for large values of n,
// and there are more optimized algorithms for calculating Fibonacci numbers.
